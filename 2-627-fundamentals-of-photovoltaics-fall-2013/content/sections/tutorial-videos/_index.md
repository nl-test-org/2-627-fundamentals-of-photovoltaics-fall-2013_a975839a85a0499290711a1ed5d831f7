These short videos use tabletop demonstrations and animated graphics to explain several fundamental photovoltaic topics.{{< video-gallery-item href="/sections/tutorial-videos/tutorial-texturing" section="Tutorial Videos" title="Tutorial: Texturing" description="Description: This video shows how solar cell efficiency is improved by wet etching the silicon wafer surface into microscopic pyramids, so that more incident light is trapped within in the cell rather than reflected back into the air. Instructor: Joe Sullivan" thumbnail="https://img.youtube.com/vi/69H3kTwques/default.jpg" >}} {{< video-gallery-item href="/sections/tutorial-videos/tutorial-doping" section="Tutorial Videos" title="Tutorial: Doping" description="Description: Pure silicon has very low conductivity. This tutorial explains how doping, the addition of very small amounts of elements like P and B to the base silicon material, creates mobile charges that dramatically boost the materials conductivity. Instructor: Joe Sullivan" thumbnail="https://img.youtube.com/vi/k12GMjtN8aA/default.jpg" >}} {{< video-gallery-item href="/sections/tutorial-videos/tutorial-photoconductivity" section="Tutorial Videos" title="Tutorial: Photoconductivity" description="Description: This video describes how light shining on a Si semiconductor causes its conductivity to rise. The energy of photons hitting the semiconductor breaks covalent bonds within the material, creating mobile electrons and holes. Instructor: Joe Sullivan" thumbnail="https://img.youtube.com/vi/20GlFVyxqHY/default.jpg" >}} {{< video-gallery-item href="/sections/tutorial-videos/tutorial-solar-cell-operation" section="Tutorial Videos" title="Tutorial: Solar Cell Operation" description="Description: This video summarizes how a solar cell turns light-induced mobile charges into electricity. It highlights the cells physical structure with layers with different dopants, and the roles played by electric fields and diffusion of holes and electrons.
